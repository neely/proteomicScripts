# fasta2UniProt Scripts

This will contain various helper scripts with the general goal of making non-UniProt fasta into quasi-UniProt fasta.

The first script, named generically convert_fasta_headers.py, was created to make an in-house protein fasta look like a UniProt fasta. This situation is described in the file itself.

There will be another script, RefSeq2UniProt.py , which will build off of the addGeneSymbol2RefSeq has done. But I haven't done this yet.
