This is a collection of helper scripts used to make some very broad descriptive statements about peptide level identifications made using the same sample but against different fasta. These scripts were used in the Shah et al. paper on black widow proteomcs, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.11.648442v1 , which links to all files used. Here in this directory are a few of those example files.
